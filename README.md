#Box Storage Management System

##1.Background
As a multicultural education city, Hong Kong colleges have many international students worldwide. And when a long vacation comes, the students may return to their hometown. However, their stuff which is heavy to carry, might be left in Hong Kong for convenience. And as the college does not provide storage services. They use the storage service provided by the student union, which is inconvenient and causes mass for the staff to manage. In this case, we come out with the X-BOX system, a Box storage management system, to help them improve efficiency and quality.

##3.User Guide
For Users to use the System, they first need to register and login into their account.
They can request empty boxes to store their things on the Request page.
And input the boxids to store the boxes after finishing packing.
And return the empty boxes after they get back their stuff.
During the whole process, they can press the summary button to check the situation of the boxes.

For Admin, they need to login into the admin account which already exists in the Database.
The Admin can input the client id to know the amount of the bills and check whether they pay the correct amount.
